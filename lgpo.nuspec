    <description>
LGPO.exe is a command-line utility that is designed to help automate management of Local Group Policy. Using local policy gives administrators a simple way to verify the effects of Group Policy settings, and is also useful for managing non-domain-joined systems. LGPO.exe can import and apply settings from Registry Policy (Registry.pol) files, security templates, Advanced Auditing backup files, and from formatted "LGPO text" files. It can export local policy to a GPO backup. It can export the contents of a Registry Policy file to the "LGPO text" format that can then be edited, and can build a Registry Policy file from an LGPO text file.
